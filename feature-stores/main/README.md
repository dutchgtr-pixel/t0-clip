# Main Feature Store (T-Certified)

This directory contains the canonical SQL feature store definitions used by the
T₀-Certified Closed-Loop Intelligence Pipeline.

## Contents
- `sql/` — modular, versioned SQL feature definitions
- `contracts/` — feature contracts and invariants (optional; add as needed)
- `docs/`  certification rules, leakage proofs, refresh semantics (this repo uses the top-level .md docs)

This store corresponds to **Part II  T-Certified Feature Stores** of the paper series.
