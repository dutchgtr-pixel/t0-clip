# Drift-Tolerant Certification (Public)

This directory contains public, platform-agnostic certification procedures and documentation
for drift-tolerant feature store certification. It supports controlled rebaselining, invariant checks,
and fail-closed guard patterns.

This corresponds to Part II (T₀-Certified Feature Stores / Governance Layer).
